  //  A layout is an ERC721 that defines how different Layouts and Geometries nest within each other
  //  Layout gets extended to create, for example a humanoid, animal, or face layout
  //  A layout should construct SVG data of its children for its parent
  //  A layout should also return a constructed image for demonstration purposes
  //  Layouts children can be reassigned, but the datastructure itself cannot be changed
